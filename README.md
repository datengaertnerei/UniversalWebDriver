# UniversalWebDriver
Example for a Selenium WebDriver Wrapper class to take care of all the usual stuff.

This is one of the wrapper classes everyone build sooner or later for his own Selenium testing effort. It will

* allow you to choose the type of browser at runtime with a configuration file
* allow you to use remote webdriver instances like Selenium grids with that configuration file
* take care of download and configuration of webdriver binaries as needed
* encapsulate the getScreenshotAs(OutputType<X>) method
